<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to develop a web application that simulates basic functionalities of Facebook with a strong emphasis on security. The application will feature user authentication, real-time messaging, and content management functionalities. A high-level architecture diagram will be added to visually represent these components.</p>

<h2>System Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>High-level Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Secure user authentication and authorization.</li>
  <li>Real-time messaging between users.</li>
  <li>User ability to manage personal content securely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Design</h2>
<p>Design will be elaborated starting from Sprint 1 and updated continuously as the project evolves.</p>

<h2>Use-Case Realization</h2>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p>The database will use a relational schema to store user data, posts, and messages, ensuring data integrity and supporting efficient queries.</p>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>The user interface will be clean and intuitive, enabling easy navigation and access to all features, with specific attention to usability and security.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Implementation details will be updated starting from Sprint 1, but the environment setup and preliminary technology choices are prepared in Sprint 0.</p>
<p>We will use PHP for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. Initial setup includes configuring a development environment, establishing a version control system, and setting up a continuous integration pipeline.</p>

<h2>Security Analysis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Applied security principles include input validation, parameterized queries, and encrypted communications.</li>
  <li>Database security is ensured through the use of roles and permissions to control access.</li>
  <li>Defenses against XSS and SQL Injection are implemented via sanitizing inputs and using ORM techniques respectively.</li>
  <li>Role separation is achieved through differentiated user permissions in the database schema and code logic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demo (Screenshots)</h2>
<p>Screenshots will be added to demonstrate each major functionality, accompanied by a brief description to illustrate the application flow and security features.</p>

<h2>Software Process Management</h2>
<p>Our team uses the Scrum methodology with two-week sprints. Tasks are assigned during sprint planning meetings, and progress is reviewed in daily stand-ups and sprint reviews.</p>

<h3>Sprint 0</h3>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 04/06/2025 - [End Date]</p>
<p><strong>Completed Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Project setup on Bitbucket</li>
  <li>Initial development environment configuration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contributions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Naga Satya: 10 commits, 15 hours - focused on backend setup and initial security measures.</li>
  <li>Upendra: 8 commits, 12 hours - worked on frontend initial setup and design mockups.</li>
  <li>Vignesh Yanamalamanda: 9 commits, 14 hours - responsible for setting up the database architecture, including the initial schema and security configurations.</li>
</ul>
